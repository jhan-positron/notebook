# Intel AMX / TRON Decode Artifacts

Preserved copies of the Intel AMX / TRON decode-analysis artifacts generated
in the Codex chat `Follow README instructions`. The canonical copies live in a
mutable local workspace, so these repo copies protect the report and diagram
from workspace cleanup.

Repo copies are mirrors: edit the canonical files first, then refresh these
copies during the next handoff run.

- What it is: self-contained HTML report explaining Intel AMX on Xeon 6,
  TRON/gpt-oss decode pipeline placement, software-attention versus
  Attention-on-FPGA scope, AMX opportunity ranking, testing strategy, and a
  current-head review of https://github.com/positron-ai/tron/pull/2934.

- Canonical:

- What it is: standalone corrected Archer/TRON forward-pass pipeline diagram.
  It separates CPU software-attention work from FPGA matmul ownership, marks
  AoF as planned scope, labels K/V as host DDR5 DRAM for CPU attention, and
  captures the later spacing/readability fixes.

- Canonical:

- What it is: compact preserved subset of the Bill PR2934 benchmark:
  fixed-light performance chart, summary CSV, analysis JSON, run-suite script,
  runtron-bin override patch, occupancy-capture script, and source SHA record.
  The raw benchmark result trees and logs remain only at the canonical path.
